# Auto-G16 Changelog

All notable public release changes are recorded here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- `auto-g16-reaction-workflow`, an offline hash-bound reaction-intake,
  species-registry, balance-review, and condition-model foundation.
- `auto-g16-reaction-literature`, an offline-first Crossref/OpenAlex discovery,
  deduplication, screening, source-evidence, and fail-closed review workflow.
- MIT licensing and a minimal offline GitHub Actions regression workflow.

### Changed

- Replaced machine-specific Mac, Windows, RTwin, and private-host values in
  published runtime paths with local configuration or environment variables.
- Aligned the public capability summary, release branding, deployment status,
  and current limitations with the eight version-controlled Auto-G16 Skills.
- Made the closed-loop runner accept only an already reviewed Gaussian input;
  removed its built-in research-method defaults and added an exact hash-bound
  live-submission approval record.

### Safety

- The fixed server boundary remains `/home/user100/SDL`; there is no remote-root
  override.
- Raw structures and SMILES cannot enter the live runner before the three-tier
  protocol proposal, explicit selection and exact offline input review.
- This release grants no Gaussian submission, cancellation, overwrite,
  deployment, or server-file deletion authorization.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-14

- Standardized all stable repository-owned Skill names under `auto-g16-*` and
  all human-facing Skill names under `Auto-G16`.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-14

- Published the guarded RTwin/PBS, TS–Freq–IRC, structure, preview, and
  asymmetric-catalysis baseline.
