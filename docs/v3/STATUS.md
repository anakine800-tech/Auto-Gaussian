# Auto-G16 v3 Status

- **Current phase:** `V30-3A` Approval Contract Freeze. Independent Contract
  Review is PASS and the V30-3A contract is FROZEN; approval implementation
  remains unauthorized.
- **Completed:** Phase 0 and Phase 0.6 owner decisions are confirmed.
- **Completed:** The minimal documentation control plane is materialized on the
  isolated documentation branch.
- **Completed:** The committed control plane passed the nine-item Phase 0 exit
  review.
- **Completed:** The first Core Interface Review milestone is PASS WITH
  CONDITIONS. The `auto_g16.core` path and immutable keyword-only domain-record
  interface are approved; canonical payload encoding stays private and
  `ExecutionSnapshot` stays excluded.
- **Completed:** Independent Final Core Review is PASS with P0=0, P1=0, P2=0,
  and P3=0; all four earlier P1 findings are closed.
- **Completed:** The four bounded P1 remediations now provide a unique explicit
  concurrent submission winner, persisted single-root enforcement, exact
  schema-v1 reopen identity validation, and semantic public payload views with
  private tagged encoding. Their focused and adversarial offline acceptance
  checks pass on the current candidate.
- **Completed:** Core public boundary freeze is PASS. The reviewed public
  exports, record fields, enums, errors, store methods, schema-v1 contract, and
  private-implementation boundary are frozen.
- **Completed:** V30-CORE-01 was merged to `main` at
  `d8f657d1f31a07f93cc9f58e2fa9cabe2cf8b1c7`; post-merge main CI is PASS on
  that exact SHA.
- **Completed:** `V3-MAINT-TEST-01` was merged by normal merge in PR #63 and is
  integrated on `main` at `a2c092e3a089e8803054e75ab3828c079db185b5`.
  Exact-main post-merge CI is PASS and product findings are `0`.
- **Closed:** `V3-MAINT-TEST-02` is integrated and CLOSED on
  `main@56eee913ca0041ce6b26aa1d2c9b8a807114b078`.
- **Validation disposition:** The PR #63 and exact-main control-plane full
  attestations took approximately 77 minutes as expected. This is integration
  evidence, not a permanent target or a reason for ordinary leaf v3 PRs to run
  the legacy-heavy full suite.
- **Completed candidate:** The Post-Core autonomy policy, three-workstream
  Integration Owner structure, validation policy, and four Task Contracts are
  frozen in [`AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT.md`](AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT.md). Planning
  completion does not authorize implementation.
- **Satisfied / integrated:** `V30-RESULT-01` is integrated on
  `main@9b771eb758e80dc8818e2022016bdef9db7075e7`; its exact-main affected CI and
  CodeQL are PASS.
- **Satisfied / integrated:** `V30-EXEC-01` is integrated on
  `main@2911451eb91a63c4c1df7601b4ac49610b6205a3`; its exact-main affected CI
  and CodeQL are PASS.
- **Closed:** `V3-MAINT-TEST-03` and `V30-INTEGRATION-CLOSEOUT-01` are
  integrated on `main@6ab92707d3ff5c2f930c8566b8631684a16d4e22`;
  exact-main `v3-full` CI and CodeQL are PASS.
- **Contract frozen:** V30-3A freezes separate Scientific Approval, exact
  finite-set Batch Submit Approval, and exact ExecutionSnapshot Operational
  Confirmation authorities, owned by the future `auto_g16.approval` package.
  It changes no Core API/schema and reopens neither the EXEC nor RESULT
  contract.
- **Wait:** `V30-EXEC-02 = WAIT`; no work is authorized.
- **Live:** `NO-GO`; integration grants no SSH, PBS, Gaussian, deployment, or
  other live-effect authority.
- **Next gate:** After V30-3A integration, activate explicit validation
  ownership for `auto_g16.approval/**` and `tests/v3/approval/**` under a
  separate Owner Gate.
- **CI monitoring:** GitHub `Z` timestamps are UTC; owner-facing reports convert
  them to local time. Do not report unchanged status minute by minute, rerun a
  still-running job, impose an unapproved timeout, or classify a slow harness
  as a product failure. Report state changes, anomalies, and terminal status.
- **Do not start:** `V30-3B` approval implementation, validation-ownership
  changes without their separate Owner Gate, `V30-EXEC-02`, production
  changes, deployment, live smoke, and SSH/PBS/Gaussian operations remain
  unauthorized.
