# Auto-G16 v3 Status

- **Current phase:** `V30-CORE-01 = CLOSED`; Post-Core Planning Gate is
  `COMPLETE-CANDIDATE` on local evidence and requires Independent Planning
  Review.
- **Completed:** Phase 0 and Phase 0.6 owner decisions are confirmed.
- **Completed:** The minimal documentation control plane is materialized on the
  isolated documentation branch.
- **Completed:** The committed control plane passed the nine-item Phase 0 exit
  review.
- **Completed:** The first Core Interface Review milestone is PASS WITH
  CONDITIONS. The `auto_g16.core` path and immutable keyword-only domain-record
  interface are approved; canonical payload encoding stays private and
  `ExecutionSnapshot` stays excluded.
- **Completed:** Independent Final Core Review is PASS with P0=0, P1=0, P2=0,
  and P3=0; all four earlier P1 findings are closed.
- **Completed:** The four bounded P1 remediations now provide a unique explicit
  concurrent submission winner, persisted single-root enforcement, exact
  schema-v1 reopen identity validation, and semantic public payload views with
  private tagged encoding. Their focused and adversarial offline acceptance
  checks pass on the current candidate.
- **Completed:** Core public boundary freeze is PASS. The reviewed public
  exports, record fields, enums, errors, store methods, schema-v1 contract, and
  private-implementation boundary are frozen.
- **Completed:** V30-CORE-01 was merged to `main` at
  `d8f657d1f31a07f93cc9f58e2fa9cabe2cf8b1c7`; post-merge main CI is PASS on
  that exact SHA.
- **Completed candidate:** The Post-Core autonomy policy, three-workstream
  Integration Owner structure, validation policy, and four Task Contracts are
  frozen in [`AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT.md`](AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT.md). Planning
  completion does not authorize implementation.
- **In progress:** Independent Planning Review only; Core feature expansion is
  stopped.
- **Next gate:** Independent Planning Review. No implementation lane may start
  from planning completion alone.
- **Not started:** `V3-MAINT-TEST-01`, `V30-EXEC-01`, and `V30-RESULT-01` are
  `NOT STARTED`; `V30-EXEC-02` is `NOT STARTED / WAIT` pending RTwin validation
  of the execution/transport public boundary.
- **CI monitoring:** GitHub `Z` timestamps are UTC; owner-facing reports convert
  them to local time. Do not report unchanged status minute by minute, rerun a
  still-running job, impose an unapproved timeout, or classify a slow harness
  as a product failure. Report state changes, anomalies, and terminal status.
- **Do not start:** `ExecutionSnapshot`, transport, execution-safety, conformer,
  knowledge, reaction, or TS implementation; production changes, deployment,
  live smoke, and SSH/PBS/Gaussian operations also remain unauthorized.
