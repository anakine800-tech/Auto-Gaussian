# Auto-G16 v3 Boundary Specification

This document fixes stable dependency and data boundaries only. It does not
select implementation techniques.

## Dependency Direction

`Skills -> Workflows -> Core`

Skills compose workflows, and workflows depend on Core. Core must not depend
on a Skill. Reverse imports across this direction are forbidden.

## Core Objects

- `Project`: durable workspace identity and collection boundary.
- `WorkflowRun`: one invocation of a reviewed workflow definition.
- `Batch`: a related set of tasks scheduled or reviewed together.
- `Task`: one planned unit of work within a workflow.
- `Attempt`: one no-overwrite execution instance for a task.
- `CalculationPlan`: the current semantically reviewed calculation intent.
- `ResourceSpec`: requested compute resources, separate from scientific intent.
- `Observation`: typed evidence about execution or program state.
- `Result`: parsed output presented for scientific review.
- `RecoveryProposal`: a proposal for a new reviewed action, never an automatic
  retry instruction.

## Context Boundaries

- **Scientific:** scientific intent, method-specific review, and acceptance.
- **Workflow:** ordering, dependencies, and stage-specific stop conditions.
- **Execution Safety:** attempt allocation, no-overwrite, submission limits,
  uncertainty, and reconciliation.
- **Transport:** bounded movement and remote invocation primitives; no
  scientific policy.
- **Program Adapter:** program-specific input, invocation, and output parsing.
- **Knowledge:** reusable typed scientific and source records.
- **Runtime State:** current projects, runs, tasks, attempts, observations, and
  results.

Contexts exchange typed canonical data. A context must not pass private
implementation objects across a boundary as an implicit contract.

## Artifact Identity

Use hashes where artifact identity must be recorded. A hash is not the default
authority mechanism and does not replace semantic review of the current
`CalculationPlan`.
