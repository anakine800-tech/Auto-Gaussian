# Auto-G16 v3 Acceptance Cases

These are feature-expansion stop conditions, not authority for a live run.

## V30-CORE-01: Clean Runtime Core

**Status: SATISFIED.** Final Core Review is PASS and `V30-CORE-01 = COMPLETE`.

The Core Interface Review milestone is **PASS WITH CONDITIONS**. The
`auto_g16.core` public path, the ten immutable keyword-only domain records, and
their field-level interface are approved. Canonical payload encoding is a
private implementation detail, not a public symbol, constructor annotation,
runtime payload value, or compatibility promise. Public payload fields expose
only a deeply immutable semantic mapping view. `ExecutionSnapshot` remains
excluded.

The following satisfied conditions remain the frozen V30-CORE-01 acceptance
contract for Python 3.11 or newer:

1. A dependency-free `SQLiteRuntimeStore` persists and reloads all ten Core
   record types. It uses SQLite foreign keys, a versioned fresh-database schema,
   explicit transactions, and no implicit migration of an unknown schema. On
   reopening schema version 1, Core verifies the exact owned schema identity,
   including columns, primary and foreign keys, uniqueness, checks, and indexes;
   same-named counterfeit tables fail closed.
2. Immutable record insertion is replay-safe: an exact repeat is idempotent,
   while the same record identity with different content fails closed without
   overwriting the stored value.
3. Every stored `Attempt` starts in `PLANNED`. Its only states are `PLANNED`,
   `SUBMISSION_INTENT_RECORDED`, `SUBMITTED`, `UNKNOWN`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCEEDED`,
   `FAILED`, and `NOT_SUBMITTED`. State changes outside the documented store
   operations fail closed and leave the transaction unchanged.
4. `record_submission_intent` atomically records exactly one caller-supplied
   intent identity and moves `PLANNED -> SUBMISSION_INTENT_RECORDED`. Exactly
   one concurrent caller receives the explicit `WINNER` claim signal that may
   gate an external submission; exact replay receives the distinct `REPLAY`
   signal and cannot be mistaken for that gate. Implicit truth-value use fails
   closed, requiring an explicit `WINNER` comparison. Reusing an intent identity
   for another Attempt, or a different identity for the same Attempt, is a
   conflict. Core never invokes submission itself.
5. `record_submission_outcome` binds the recorded intent to exactly one
   `SUBMITTED` or `UNKNOWN` outcome. Exact replay is idempotent; conflicting
   outcomes fail. `UNKNOWN` never authorizes retry.
6. Reconciliation of `UNKNOWN` requires a persisted `Observation` for the same
   Attempt. `UNRESOLVED` preserves `UNKNOWN`; terminal evidence may resolve it
   once to `SUBMITTED` or `NOT_SUBMITTED`. Direct or conflicting reconciliation
   fails closed.
7. Normal execution progress permits only `SUBMITTED -> RUNNING`,
   `SUBMITTED -> SUCCEEDED|FAILED`, and `RUNNING -> SUCCEEDED|FAILED`.
   `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, and `NOT_SUBMITTED` are terminal in this slice.
8. Each Task has exactly one persisted root `Attempt`; a second parentless
   Attempt fails closed regardless of the root state. A child `Attempt` is
   created only by an explicit call after its parent is `FAILED` or
   `NOT_SUBMITTED`. It preserves the same `task_id`, records the parent identity,
   has a strictly greater positive ordinal, and is a new `PLANNED` Attempt.
   Core never creates a child automatically, and an `UNKNOWN` parent cannot
   have one or be bypassed by another root.
9. `Observation` and `Result` records are append-only, require an existing
   Attempt, survive close/reopen, retain deterministic insertion order, and
   use the same exact-replay/conflicting-identity rule. Their payload storage
   encoding remains private.
10. Public Core has no Transport, PBS, Gaussian, deployment, scheduler query,
    retry executor, cleanup, or `ExecutionSnapshot` behavior. Focused and
    adversarial tests under `tests/v3/core/` include real concurrent intent
    claim, UNKNOWN root-bypass, counterfeit-schema, and private-encoding
    counterexamples. Syntax compilation, static source checks, and
    `git diff --check` pass offline.

All conditions are satisfied. V30-CORE-01 stops at this boundary; completion
does not authorize another v3 slice.

## V30-EXEC-01: Frozen Offline Execution Boundary

**Status: SATISFIED / INTEGRATED ON
`main@2911451eb91a63c4c1df7601b4ac49610b6205a3`.** The numbered conditions
below remain the acceptance contract; integration grants no SSH, RTwin, PBS,
Gaussian, deployment, or other live-effect authority:

1. Semantically identical snapshots keep one identity across JSON key order or
   formatting changes.
2. Any effect-relevant field change produces a new snapshot identity.
3. Mutable ServerProfile changes stale an unexecuted snapshot and require fresh
   resolution.
4. Windows relative, home-relative, and `~` paths are rejected.
5. POSIX relative or non-canonical paths are rejected.
6. PBS template identity derives from exact bytes; an opaque caller ID is
   rejected.
7. `PreparedInputBinding` binds exact prepared bytes durably to the
   CalculationPlan, revision, and Attempt.
8. `ResolvedResourceRequest` binds the exact ResourceSpec and effect-time
   values while remaining separate from scientific intent.
9. An existing Project can receive a fresh Attempt workspace.
10. Local, RTwin, and server workspaces are Attempt-specific, contained,
    no-follow where effectful, and no-overwrite.
11. Partial workspace allocation persists explicitly and never masquerades as
    globally no effect.
12. Concurrent claims yield exactly one Core `WINNER` for a submission intent
    and at most one submission call for the Attempt.
13. `REPLAY` makes zero adapter or external-effect calls.
14. Pre-effect failure records no-effect evidence and is not `UNKNOWN`.
15. Possibly effectful submission ambiguity becomes `UNKNOWN`.
16. `UNKNOWN` permits same-Attempt reconciliation, never automatic retry.
17. Minimal `RemoteEffectReceipt` replay is idempotent and conflicting content
    is rejected; all three frozen effect states and `effect_sequence` are
    covered.
18. The RTwin synthetic adapter needs no real SSH, PBS, or Gaussian.
19. Core remains transport-free.
20. No `qdel`, cancellation, deletion, cleanup, deployment, or live behavior is
    exercised or authorized.

## V30-RESULT-01: Frozen Result Provenance Boundary

**Status: SATISFIED / INTEGRATED ON
`main@2911451eb91a63c4c1df7601b4ac49610b6205a3`.** The numbered conditions
below remain the acceptance contract and do not grant scientific acceptance or
live-effect authority:

1. UUIDv5 namespaces are source-controlled and caller-invariant.
2. Exact replay of the input tuple (`attempt_id`, `calculation_plan_id`,
   `calculation_plan_revision`, `prepared_input_binding_id`,
   `execution_snapshot_id`) produces the same identity.
3. A changed plan revision, prepared input binding, or snapshot identity
   produces a new input-binding identity.
4. Malformed envelope metadata fails closed without a false legal envelope.
5. A valid complete envelope persists under the exact tuple
   (`attempt_id`, `input_binding_observation_id`, `capture_source_id`,
   `capture_manifest_sha256`, `capture_completeness`).
6. A valid partial envelope persists and remains explicitly incomplete.
7. A valid envelope with unparseable output is preserved with an explicit
   `unparseable` Result outcome.
8. `unsupported` output or parser status remains distinct from malformed
   metadata.
9. Exact Result tuple (`envelope_observation_id`, `parser_name`,
   `parser_version`, `result_kind`) replay is idempotent.
10. The same Result identity with a different payload conflicts.
11. A new parser version produces a new Result identity without overwriting the
    earlier result.
12. Multiple captures remain append-only.
13. A Result never splices facts or provenance across captures.
14. The current view chooses the latest legal complete capture by deterministic
    insertion order.
15. With no complete capture, the current view exposes the latest partial
    capture as explicitly incomplete.
16. Durable incomplete prefixes survive close and reopen.
17. Result creation and reading never change Attempt runtime state.
18. Result existence and parser status do not grant scientific acceptance.
19. Synthetic artifacts require no live RTwin or PBS.
20. Core API and schema remain unchanged.

## v3.0: Closed-Shell Minimum

A real closed-shell minimum completes:

`structure -> plan -> submit -> observe -> fetch -> parse -> ReviewBundle`

When this case meets its reviewed acceptance criteria, stop v3.0 feature
expansion.

## v3.1: Flexible-Molecule Ensemble

A real flexible molecule completes:

`xTB preopt -> CREST -> audit -> DFT -> Freq -> qRRHO -> ensemble`

When this case meets its reviewed acceptance criteria, stop v3.1 feature
expansion.

## v3.2a: Representative Reaction

A representative reaction completes:

`ReactionPlan -> TS search -> mode review -> bidirectional IRC -> endpoints -> barrier`

When this case meets its reviewed acceptance criteria, stop v3.2a feature
expansion.
